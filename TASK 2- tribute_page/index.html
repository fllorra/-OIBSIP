          Paul William Walker IV, born on September 12, 1973 in Glendale,
          California, was an American actor. His journey in show business began
          as a child actor in the 1980s. Walker gained recognition in the 1990s
          after appearing in the television soap opera “The Young and the
          Restless.” He received praise for his performances in the teen comedy
          “She’s All That” and the comedy-drama “Varsity Blues” (both in 1999).
          However, it was his role as Brian O’Conner in “The Fast and the
          Furious” franchise that catapulted him to international fame. Walker
          became an action star, starring in commercially successful movies like
          “Joy Ride” (2001) and “Eight Below” (2006). Despite some box-office
          disappointments, he earned acclaim for his performance in the survival
          drama “Eight Below” and his portrayal of Hank Hansen in “Flags of Our
          Fathers” (both in 2006).

            On November 30, 2013, Walker tragically died in a single-vehicle
            collision in Santa Clarita, California. His legacy lives on through
            his impactful performances and the enduring impact of the “Fast &
            Furious” series. The song “See You Again” by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie
            Puth was commissioned as a tribute in the film “Furious 7” (2015),
            where his brothers Cody and Caleb stood in for him during filming.

            to resonate with fans worldwide.<br /> <br>

            cars. No alcohol or other drugs were found in either man's
            system,and neither mechanical failure nor road conditions appeared
            to play a role. Police found no evidence of drag racing.The
            investigation concluded that the car's speed and age of the tires
            were the primary reasons for the crash. Grave of Paul Walker at
